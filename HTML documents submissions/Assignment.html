			<h1>Video games are awesome!</h1>
				<p>They even help with mental health and cognitive functions!.</p>
				<p>Here is a quote from Better Aging's website:</p>
					<blockquote cite="https://www.betteraging.com/cognitive-aging/what-is-the-impact-of-video-games-on-cognition-and-wellbeing/#:~:text=A%20host%20of%20studies%20have%20found%20that%20playing,poor%20health%2C%20under%20achievement%20and%20even%20violent%20behavior">
					<p>Some of the findings from the 35 studies include:</p>
						<p>Evidence that gaming impacts areas of cognition, including  processing speed, reaction times, memory, ability to handle tasking switching, and mental spatial rotation.</p>
						<p>Evidence that playing physically active video games (think Nintendo Wii) can have a positive influence on emotional responses.</p>
						<p>Some commercial video games can help users develop better stress management, such as horror-based video games used as part of a program to improve soldierâ€™s resilience to stress.</p>
						<p>Video games have helped those with anxiety handle emotional and psychological responses to stressors.</p>
						<p>Video games have improved performance of women during anxiety-related tasks.</p>
